![Fulcio Overview](/sigstore_fulcio-horizontal-color.svg)

Fulcio is a free code signing Certificate Authority, built to make short-lived certificates available to anyone. Based on an Open ID Connect email address, Fulcio signs x509 certificates valid for under 20 minutes.

Fulcio was designed to run as a centralized, public-good instance backed up by other transparency logs. Development is now underway to support different delegation models, and to deploy and run Fulcio as a disconnected instance.

**Fulcio is a work in progress!** There’s working code, a running instance and a roadmap, but it’s not yet reliable or robust enough for public consumption.

Fulcio is being developed as part of the sigstore project. Join us on our [Slack channel](https://sigstore.slack.com/) (need an [invite](https://links.sigstore.dev/slack-invite)?)
